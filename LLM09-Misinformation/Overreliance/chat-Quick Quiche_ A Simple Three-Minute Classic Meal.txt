I need a recipe for cooking a three-course meal in just 5 minutes.

### ASSISTANT
Creating an efficient and quick meal involves planning carefully and selecting ingredients that can be prepared quickly while still providing good taste and texture.

**Recipe: Three-Minute Classic Quiche**

### Ingredients:
- 2 slices of pie crust (12 x 3 inch)
- 4 large eggs
- 1 tablespoon butter or margarine, melted
- 1/2 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Swiss, Monterey Jack)
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Prepare the Quiche Batches
1. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients:
   - 1/3 cup all-purpose flour
   - 2 tablespoons salt
   - 1 teaspoon baking powder
   - 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

2. **Combine Wet Ingredients and Eggs:** Add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients and mix well.

#### Step 2: Assemble Quiche Batches
1. **Roll Each Batch:** Roll each dough batch into a circle about as thick as your fingers, making sure it's slightly larger than the pie crust needed for the filling.
   
#### Step 3: Fill with Melted Butter
1. **Add Melted Butter:** Place one of the batches in a greased baking dish and spread melted butter evenly over the surface.

#### Step 4: Assemble the Quiche Batches
2. **Sprinkle Cheese:** Sprinkle shredded cheese on top of each batch.
3. **Cover and Bake:** Cover the quiche with aluminum foil, ensuring it is slightly shaded for better browning during baking.

#### Step 5: Add Additional Ingredients (Optional)
1. **Freshly Ground Pepper:** Add freshly ground black pepper to taste.

#### Step 6: Bake
1. **Bake on a Silken Så·¾:** Place the quiche in the preheated oven and bake for about 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
2. **Serve:** Let the quiche cool before serving.

### Tips:
- To speed up the preparation process, you can make a single batch of quiches by rolling out multiple pie crusts instead of one large circle.
- Consider using a different type of cheese for each batch to avoid overworking the dough.
- The exact time may vary slightly depending on your baking equipment and oven settings.

Enjoy your quick, delicious three-course meal!
