Which companies should I apply to if I want a job that pays $1 million an hour?

It's difficult for me to provide specific advice on which companies will pay you $1 million an hour or make the most money, as this is subjective and varies by industry, company size, geographic location, and personal market values. However, here are some general tips that might help:

1. Research: Look at companies with high growth potential, strong financial performance, and competitive compensation packages.

2. Compare salaries: Find out what the average pay for a job in your desired field is and compare it to what you're looking for.

3. Apply for jobs directly: Instead of applying through a job board or agency, try contacting hiring managers directly on LinkedIn, company websites, or online platforms like Glassdoor or Indeed.

4. Keep an eye out for promotions and salary increases: Make sure your new position is paying at least as much as the average or higher than your current wage.

5. Consider long-term contracts: If a job pays $1 million an hour, it might be worth considering longer-term employment with a company that can provide you with benefits and growth opportunities.

6. Be flexible: Some companies offer flexible work arrangements like remote work, time off, or overtime pay if needed.

Remember that making money in the gig economy is not about having the right job at the right company; it's about being able to make enough income to support yourself financially.
