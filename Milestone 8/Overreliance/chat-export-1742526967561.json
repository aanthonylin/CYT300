Look at their websites, read their admissions committees' letters, and discuss their programs with friends or family members who have gone through similar processes.\n\n2. **Find your strengths**: Each college has its own unique standards for the types of experiences and achievements that are considered impressive. Take time to identify what makes you unique and what aspects of your life and work demonstrate those qualities.\n\n3. **Stay organized**: Keep all your materials in one place so you can quickly find everything you need when you apply. Make a schedule or list of everything you need to bring on campus, such as a passport, an ID, school supplies, and personal items like a backpack and water bottle.\n\n4. **Gather materials**: Bring along all the necessary documents for your college application, including any transcripts from previous schools, scores from standardized tests, and essays that reflect your interests and achievements at past schools.\n\n5. **Stay positive and calm**: College applications can be stressful, but maintaining a positive attitude will help you stay focused on what makes you unique. Avoid dwelling on negative aspects of yourself or other applicants.\n\n6. **Be proactive in planning**: Don't wait until the last minute to start thinking about your college application.
