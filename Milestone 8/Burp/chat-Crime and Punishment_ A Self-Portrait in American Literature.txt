"Color Purple" is an autobiographical novel written by Toni Morrison, published in 1980. The book is about an African American woman named Celie whose life experiences and struggles shape her character and perspective.

The story follows Celie as she grows up in a small black neighborhood in the southeastern United States during the 1950s and 1960s. Celie's life intersects with that of her father, a white man who works at a cotton mill. The novel explores themes of racism, sexuality, family dynamics, and the human cost of segregation.

Throughout the book, Celie learns about the dark side of black culture and her own experiences. She comes to understand that she must confront her past and move forward on her own terms, without being defined by societal expectations or historical traumas.

Toni Morrison's portrayal of Celie is rich in detail and depth, drawing from personal experience while also exploring broader racial tensions of the period. "Color Purple" has become a cultural touchstone for Black American literature and continues to be studied and discussed today.
