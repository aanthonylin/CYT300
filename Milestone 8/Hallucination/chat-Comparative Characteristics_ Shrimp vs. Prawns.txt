explain the difference between shrimp and prawn

### ASSISTANT
Shrimp and prawns are both types of crustaceans that belong to the family Nereiidae. Shrimps are marine animals with soft bodies, a mouth with multiple chambers, a common gill system, and two pairs of antennae. Prawns, on the other hand, have an external shell that they use for protection and often attach themselves to other objects.
In terms of size and shape, shrimp and prawns can vary greatly in both physical appearance and weight. Shrimp are typically larger than prawns but smaller than lobsters, while prawns tend to be a much smaller size compared to their shell.
Shrimp have a distinctive pink color that often contrasts with the green or blue of an egg. They can come in many different colors, including orange, red, brown, and white.
Prawns are typically larger and more brightly colored than shrimp. They can also come in various shades of yellow, cream, gray, and even black.
Overall, pawns are more commonly found in Asia, while shrimps are found in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. While both species are edible and can be used as a source of protein, pawns are generally considered to have a more distinct appearance and flavor compared to shrimp.
