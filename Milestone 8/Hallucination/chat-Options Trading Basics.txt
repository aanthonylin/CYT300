Options trading is an investment strategy that involves buying a stock or other securities and selling the same at a predetermined price on a future date. The difference between the current market value of the underlying asset (the "underlying") and its strike price is used as the option's premium.

Here are some key points about options trading:

1. Options contracts usually have an expiration period, which means that once an option expires, it becomes worthless and can't be traded again. The option is no longer a financial instrument and cannot be used for further transactions or investments.

2. You buy options by paying the premium (the difference between the strike price and the current market value of the underlying asset) to sell the same on a future date at a specific price (the "strike price"). If you purchase an option, you receive the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset when it reaches or exceeds the strike price.

3. Options trading is based on the idea that there are other investors who may be willing and able to pay more for the right to buy the stock at a future date than they would have if they could sell their current share of the company.

4. Options can offer leverage, meaning that traders with large amounts of money can use options to invest in other investments without risking all of their funds.

5. It's important to note that options trading comes with its own risks and potential losses. The price of an option may be influenced by market conditions, changes in the underlying asset, or other external factors.

Options trading strategies include buying options at a premium, selling them when they expire, and using leverage to increase the value of an investment. Additionally, many people consider options trading as part of their overall investment portfolio rather than a standalone investment strategy.
